# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption of text. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypt a given message with a specified shift value.
- Decrypt a given message with a specified shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters in their original positions.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This program is compatible with Python 3.

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the `Task-01.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `Task-01.py` is located.
4. Run the program using the following command:
    ```sh
    python Task-01.py
    ```

### Program Flow

1. The program will prompt you to choose between encryption and decryption.
2. Enter the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the shift value (an integer).
4. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

### Example

#### Encrypt a Message

```sh
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
